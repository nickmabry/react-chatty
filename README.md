# Chatty

This is just a basic Phoenix template with react support. It pulls in React
0.14 and ReactRouter 0.13.x. Until I find a solution for properly requiring
bower modules from Brunch, `React` and `ReactRouter` are available as global
variables, but ES6 module syntax is used elsewhere.

To start your Phoenix app:

  1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  2. Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  3. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
